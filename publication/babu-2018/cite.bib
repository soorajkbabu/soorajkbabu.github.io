 abstract = {Immersive learning environments are increasingly being adopted as modern alternative presentation modes in training scenarios. Presently, the improved levels of engagement and interactions offered by these systems are expected to potentially motivate the learners more than conventional 2D interfaces. This study compares the effectiveness of immersive environments with conventional 2D learning content for a motorcycle labeling task by evaluating knowledge retention and recall. The study was conducted with two groups of participants: A VR interaction group and a tablet based 2D interaction group. The enhanced spatial interaction capability of VR was hypothesized to promote knowledge retention and improve the instructional utility of immersive learning solutions.},
