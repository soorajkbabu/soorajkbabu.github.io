 abstract = {This paper introduces Pepe Jr, a 4 DOF robotic lamp, designed as a cost-effective platform for Human Robot Interaction research. We discuss the mechanical and electronic design aspects of the robot, and the design of the motion patterns associated with each emotion expressed by the robot. We also discuss results from a battery of surveys to gauge user perception of these expressed emotions, which validate the design objectives of the robot.},
