 abstract = {We introduce Kappa, an electronic tangible interface development kit designed to promote computational thinking for school students. Kappa enables students to create interactive games, animated stories and musical instruments using physical objects. We discuss the design considerations, the working mechanism and the need for such a toolkit in technology education. We also discuss results and observations from a pilot deployment of the kit in a school in urban India in a project-based learning context.},
