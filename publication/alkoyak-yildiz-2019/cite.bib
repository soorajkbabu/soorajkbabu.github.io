 abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) technology enables students to be trained in new behaviour in an authentic and situated learning context. The pilot study investigated the effects of a scaffolded five-minutes 360-degree video-based VR training on communication skills, achievement emotions and motivation among university students in India. The results of an experimental trial with repeated measures show, except for a slight rise in positive emotions for the control group, no significant differences in the VR-condition. Nevertheless, students are highly convinced that VR-Training has the potential to improve their academic skills and performance. High acceptance of VR-based education and the potential to replace real education settings at university level were observed.},
